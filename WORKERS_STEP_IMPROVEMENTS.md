# Workers Step Improvements

## Overview
The workers step in the onboarding process has been significantly improved to provide a better user experience and more comprehensive functionality for adding team members.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multiple Addition Methods
- **Single Worker Addition**: Add workers one by one with detailed information
- **Bulk Import**: Import multiple workers at once using CSV format
- **Skip Option**: Allow users to skip adding workers and complete this step later

### 2. Enhanced User Interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean, organized interface with three main tabs
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback showing workers ready to be added
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices

### 3. Better Data Management
- **Worker List Management**: Add multiple workers before saving
- **Remove Functionality**: Remove workers from the list before saving
- **Bulk Operations**: Import and manage multiple workers efficiently

### 4. Improved Form Fields
- **Position Dropdown**: Predefined list of common construction positions
- **Optional Email**: Email is now optional for workers
- **Better Validation**: More robust validation with clear error messages
- **Default Values**: Smart defaults like today's date for start date

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- **Clear Instructions**: Helpful alerts and descriptions for each method
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages and loading states
- **Flexible Workflow**: Users can add workers in batches or skip entirely
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows how many workers are ready to be added

## Technical Features

### Form Schema
```typescript
const workerSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Worker name is required'),
  email: z.string().email('Valid email is required').optional().or(z.literal('')),
  phone: z.string().min(1, 'Phone number is required'),
  position: z.string().min(1, 'Position is required'),
  hourly_rate: z.string().min(1, 'Hourly rate is required'),
  start_date: z.string().min(1, 'Start date is required'),
});
```

### Bulk Import Format
CSV format: `Name, Position, Hourly Rate, Phone`
